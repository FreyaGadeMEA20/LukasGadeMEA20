- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @FreyaGadeMEA20 - aka. Freya Gade Ravnsborg
- I have experience with Python, Java, Shader, Unity, and C#, but I am always looking to expand my toolbox.
- I like to do a bit of everything regarding programming, but my strengths lie in getting tools to work together.
  - Examples: Developing a tool in Unity for switching between Unity Timelines, getting a Python script to communicate with C# using UDP connections, controlling shaders through Unity Timelines
- You can contact me through my student mail: lravns20@student.aau.dk
