- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @LukasGadeMEA20 - aka. Gade Ravnsborg
- I have experience with Python, Java, Shader, Unity and C#, but looking to expand my toolbox.
- I am not yet sure what kind of programs I wanna develop, whether it be video games or software, so I am trying to do a bit of everything till I find out what I want to do.
- I am currently developing an Adaptive VR Narrative using Unity at Aalborg University Copenhagen at their Masters in Medialogy.
- You can contact me through my student mail: lravns20@student.aau.dk
